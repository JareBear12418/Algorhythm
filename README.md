# Music-Generator
- This project aims towards creating piano music of diffrent style and a click of a button. With a easy and simple to use user interface you can easily create diffrent genres of piano music.

## Plans
- Make pre-configured genres.
- Possibly make the generation process faster.
- Better visual GUI
- More than just piano sounds.
  - For the time being you can change the sounds yourself by going to the [Piano Samples](Piano%20Samples) folder and edit them yourself. ***DO NOT CHANGE THE FILE NAMES! If you do the program will not work and it will crash.***
- Better generating algorithms.
## ToDo 
- [x] Generate song.
- [ ] Complete Random algorithm.
- [x] Make loading `.json` file system.
- [ ] Make writing `.json` file system.
- [ ] Adding custom genres.
  - [ ] Editing genres.
  - [ ] Deleting genres.
## Bugs
- Audio clipping with `demisemiquaver` & `semiquaver` note.
  - Possible needs a longer fade.
